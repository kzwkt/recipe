    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Prepare Chicken:</h3>
            <p>Pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
            <p>Heat 1 tbsp oil in a large skillet or pot over medium-high heat. Add chicken pieces in a single layer (cook in batches if necessary to avoid overcrowding).</p>
            <p>Sear the chicken for 3-4 minutes per side until lightly browned. It doesn't need to be cooked through. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Sauté Aromatics:</h3>
            <p>Add the remaining 1 tbsp oil (or ghee) to the same pan.</p>
            <p>Add the chopped onion and cook over medium heat for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until softened and translucent.</p>
            <p>Add minced ginger and garlic. Cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant, being careful not to burn the garlic.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Bloom Spices:</h3>
            <p>Stir in the curry powder, cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper (if using). Cook for 30 seconds to 1 minute, stirring constantly, until very fragrant. This "blooming" step deepens the spice flavors.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Build the Sauce:</h3>
            <p>Stir in the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, stirring.</p>
            <p>Add the canned diced tomatoes (with their juice), chicken broth, and coconut milk. Stir well to combine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan.</p>
            <p>Bring the sauce to a gentle simmer.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Simmer the Curry:</h3>
            <p>Return the seared chicken pieces (along with any accumulated juices) to the pan.</p>
            <p>Reduce heat to low, cover the pan, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and tender. The sauce should have thickened slightly.</p>
            <p>Stir occasionally to prevent sticking.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Finish and Serve:</h3>
            <p>Stir in the garam masala. This spice blend is usually added at the end for its aromatic qualities.</p>
            <p>Taste the curry and adjust salt and pepper if needed. You can also add a squeeze of fresh lime juice for brightness if desired.</p>
            <p>Garnish with fresh cilantro before serving.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
