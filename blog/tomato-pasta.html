    <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>1 can (400g / 14 oz) crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp dried oregano</li>

    <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente. Drain, reserving about 1/2 cup of the pasta water.</li>
    <li>While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1 minute until fragrant, being careful not to burn it.</li>
